#Progress

After finishing the grid things really started to pick up and I feel more confident in
what I'm doing. CSS will obviously be trial and error but using the Dev Tool to play around
with element's margins, padding, etc really makes it easier than going back and forth
to ATOM, saving, and hoping it looks the way you want it to look.

Looking forward to the next week.
