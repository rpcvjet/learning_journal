# Learning Journal Day 11

I felt really good in class. I worked though the lab today to get three random
images posted onto the page. I followed the cookie stand template from github
but ran into a problem when it came to what to input after the 'click'...as in
what if statements to input. I will ask Frazier (who explained what I had to do)
to visually explain this concept.
