# Learning Journal Day #13

<h1>   Got a lot of help from Marc. He really helped me out in a lot of ways. It's nice to see what I can hopefully aspire too.
       I don't find the actual concepts difficult it's just difficult when you are doing them for the first time. I'd like to
       create more mock projects where I can practice making event listeners, forms, writing to the DOM,  and creating charts.
