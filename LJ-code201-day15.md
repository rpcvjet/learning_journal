#Learning Day Journal Day 15

Feels good do be done with the lectures and moving into Project Week.

While I understand this is on average a more advanced class, I feel like the

two stronger team members are already taking over the project and trying to expand

the project WAY bigger to what the requirements are. I mean, there are stretch goals

and then there are RIDICULAS goals (like including a back end MongoDB database, jQuery) and other

stuff I don't know how to use.
