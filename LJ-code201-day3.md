Loops. I studied this a lot before I got here but it's still difficult. I thought it was
quite a jump from lecture to nested loops. I really still don't get the concept of that.
I mean, I understand boolean values. I wish there could have been somewhat of an example/clue
in lecture in order to tackle question 7.

I'm glad layout lecture is tomorrow as my about me page has alignment issues.
