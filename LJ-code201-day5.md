# Learning Journal Day Five!

Wow, what a week! Even though it took me until 6:30pm to finish it, I felt good about
finishing before going home. There was a struggle but there was growth and I learned some key concepts
(how to pull information out of array, using loops, and variable naming conventions) that were
super useful.

My About Me is pretty much finished and I look forward to working on some private projects this weekend and getting some rest.
