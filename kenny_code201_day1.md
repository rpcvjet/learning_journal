<h1> Kenneth Code201 - Day 1   </h1>

I always believe that writing things down hold you accountable. So here are my goals:

1. I want to complete this course with a 100%. My only concern is that I may have to miss a morning due to a doctors appoointment.

2. I want to create one or two side projects. I really want to make this money tracking app, and a wrtiers critiquing app. 
Perhaps use jennifer dewalt's website if I can't get to those.
